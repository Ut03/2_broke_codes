This is a submission for day 3 Emids Healthcare Hackathon

We had chosen problem statement 1 (Light emr)

## Introduction
EHR or(Electronic Health Records) is a record is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically stored health information in a digital format.
This is done using an EMR which is mostly used by hospitals.

The problem that comes with EMR's in India is that they are all decentrallized ie No one is connected to another
each patients data is stored in different hospitals in different places ie(There is no sytem). There is now way of a patient to access their data fromtheir comfort of their hand in the 21st century.

## Our approach
Our approach is to start small 
Our solution implementation to this problem was to create a simple EMR for the students of our college SRMIST Chennai 
where we only have one hospital in the outskirts of the main city.

Where patient info is usually given in a blue booklet which is often damed or is lodt by the student.
He/she is not able to access thir data nor are they able to add their lab reports from other labs/hospitals back home

Given an example of the booklet



## Installation guide: üìñ
After cloning the repo or copying the code, run the following commands on your *command promt* before running the code.

## Future changes üëì
1. Develop a proper webpage 
2. Index through multiple pages
3. Better way of displaying the results
4. Using CNN model to train and test to convert handwritten images to text
5. Creating a mobile application of the same so that it is acessable
6.
