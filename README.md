This is a submission for day 3 Emids Healthcare Hackathon

We had chosen problem statement 1 (Light emr)

## Introduction
EHR or(Electronic Health Records) is a record is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically stored health information in a digital format.
This is done using an EMR which is mostly used by hospitals.

The problem that comes with EMR's in India is that they are all decentrallized ie No one is connected to another
each patients data is stored in different hospitals in different places ie(There is no sytem)

Our solution implementation to this problem was to create a simple EMR for the students of our college SRMIST Chennai where we only have one hospital in the outskirts of the main city.
